## Installation

Install the `mirror-tool` package from PyPI.

```
pip install mirror-tool
```

## Usage

`mirror-tool` has the following subcommands. Please install the tool and
run with `--help` for complete documentation on the available commands and
options.

### `mirror-tool validate-config`

Verify that `.mirror-tool.yaml` in the current directory, or a specified
configuration file, is valid.

Exits with a 0 exit code if and only if a valid config file was found.

### `mirror-tool update-local`

For each mirror defined in the config file, create a subtree merge commit
updating that mirror.

By default, this will not create any commits if there are no changes to be made.
It can be forced to create a commit by using the `--allow-empty` argument.

### `mirror-tool update`

Perform the same updates as `update-local`, but also push the commit(s) to any
configured remote targets.

Currently, GitLab is the only supported target. See the configuration reference
below for more information about GitLab integration.

When using this command to push to GitLab, it is recommended to run it from
within a GitLab CI/CD pipeline. The command will use predefined environment
variables in the CI environment to determine how to connect to GitLab.
If used in other contexts, it will be necessary to explicitly set many
environment variables.


## Configuration

`mirror-tool` requires a configuration file. By convention, this should
be placed at `.mirror-tool.yaml` at the top level of your superproject
repository.

The following example demonstrates the available configuration options.

```yaml
# Define the repositories to mirror.
mirror:
- url: https://github.com/org/repo1
  ref: refs/heads/master
  dir: repo1

- url: https://github.com/org/repo2
  ref: refs/heads/main
  dir: repo2

# Git configuration to be applied when mirror-tool creates commits.
# Any arbitrary config can be set, but this is most commonly needed
# just to set the name/email on merge commits.
git_config:
  user.name: "mirror-tool"
  user.email: "noreply@example.com"

# Configures the GitLab merge request integration.
gitlab_merge:
  # If enabled, the update command will create/update a GitLab
  # merge request whenever a mirrored repo is updated.
  enabled: true

  # Token used to authenticate with GitLab.
  #
  # Currently, this token must always be of the format '$SOME_VARIABLE',
  # and the token will be accessed from that environment variable at
  # runtime. If running from a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, this should be
  # set as a protected CI variable.
  token: $GITLAB_MIRROR_TOKEN

  # Source branch used for merge requests.
  # WARNING: update will do force pushes to this branch!
  src: latest

  # Target branch used for merge requests.
  # The following example supposes that the target branch is used
  # to perform some kind of deployment.
  dest: deploy

  # Title for the merge request.
  # This is a Jinja template.
  title: "Deploy changes [{{ datetime_day }}]"

  # Any desired labels to add onto the merge request.
  labels:
  - deploy

  # Description for the merge request.
  # This is a Jinja template.
  description: |-
    Automated update of dependencies generated by
    {{ env.CI_JOB_URL }}.

    Submitting this merge request will trigger a deployment.

  # Comment(s) to be added when a merge request is created or updated.
  # Can be used to ping reviewers.
  # If omitted, comments won't be added.
  # These are Jinja templates.
  comment:
    create: "@some-team: please review and submit."
    update: "@some-team: merge request has been updated, please re-review."
```

### Jinja context

Some configuration elements are described above as
[Jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/).
The following variables are available for use within the templates:

#### `env` (dict)

* All environment variables at the time `mirror-tool` is invoked.
* If running in GitLab CI/CD, can be used to access the
  [CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html).
* Example: `{{ env.CI_JOB_URL }}` => `https://gitlab.example.com/someteam/somerepo/-/jobs/6366493`

#### `datetime_iso8601` (str)

* Current UTC date/time, in ISO8601 format, with seconds precision.
* Example: `2022-05-10T05:28:26Z`

#### `datetime_minute` (str)

* Current UTC date/time, with minutes precision.
* Example: `2022-05-10 05:28`

#### `datetime_day` (str)

* Current UTC date.
* Example: `2022-05-10`

#### `datetime_week` (str)

* Current UTC year and week of year.
* Example: `2022wk19` for week 19 of 2022.
